      <p>
        There's no failure in sports. It's not a failure, it's steps to success. There's good days, bad days. Some days you are able to be successful, some days you are not...and that's what sports is about. You don't always win.

      <p>
        Looking at this year's draft class is like heading to your favorite steakhouse only to find out they’re out of steak.

But there’s no Wagyu porterhouse like Victor Wembanyama last year.
